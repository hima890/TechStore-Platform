Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Generate a New ED25519 SSH Key Pair
Generate a new ED25519 key pair:

sh
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_github_ed25519
-t ed25519: Specifies the type of key to create, in this case, an ED25519 key.
-C "your_email@example.com": Provides a label for the key, typically your email.
-f ~/.ssh/id_github_ed25519: Specifies the file name for the key pair.
Step 2: Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent
Start the SSH agent and add your new SSH private key to it:

sh
Copy code
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_github_ed25519
Step 3: Display Your SSH Public Key
Display your newly generated SSH public key:

sh
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_github_ed25519.pub
This will output your SSH public key, which you can then copy.

Step 4: Copy the SSH Public Key to Your Clipboard
To copy the SSH public key to your clipboard, use the following command based on your operating system:

Linux:

sh
Copy code
xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_github_ed25519.pub
If xclip is not installed, you can install it with:

sh
Copy code
sudo apt install xclip
macOS:

sh
Copy code
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_github_ed25519.pub
Windows (Git Bash or WSL):

sh
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_github_ed25519.pub | clip
Step 5: Add the SSH Public Key to Your GitHub Account
Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
In the user settings sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.
Click New SSH key.
In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key.
Paste your SSH public key into the "Key" field.
Click Add SSH key.
Step 6: Update Your SSH Configuration
Ensure your SSH configuration is set correctly. You can create or edit the SSH configuration file (~/.ssh/config) to specify the correct key for GitHub:

sh
Copy code
nano ~/.ssh/config
Add the following lines to the file:

sh
Copy code
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_github_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes
Save and close the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

Step 7: Test the SSH Connection to GitHub
Ensure that your SSH connection to GitHub is working:

sh
Copy code
ssh -T git@github.com
You should see a message like:

vbnet
Copy code
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Step 8: Clone the Repository
Now you should be able to clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
Replace username/repository with the appropriate GitHub username and repository name.
