Generate an SSH Key Pair (if you don't have one):
On your local machine, open a terminal and run:

sh
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
This will create a public/private key pair. By default, the keys will be stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa (private key) and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (public key).

Copy the Public Key to the Server:
Use the ssh-copy-id command to copy your public key to the server:

sh
Copy code
ssh-copy-id username@your_server_ip
Replace username with your actual username on the server and your_server_ip with the server's IP address. You'll be prompted to enter your password.

Manually Add the Public Key (if ssh-copy-id is not available):
Alternatively, you can manually add the public key:

Display the Public Key:

sh
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Copy the output.

Connect to the Server:

sh
Copy code
ssh username@your_server_ip
Create the .ssh Directory (if it doesn't exist):

sh
Copy code
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
Add the Public Key to the authorized_keys File:

sh
Copy code
echo "your_copied_public_key" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Test the SSH Connection:
Disconnect from the server and then try to connect again using SSH:

sh
Copy code
ssh username@your_server_ip
If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to connect without entering your password.
