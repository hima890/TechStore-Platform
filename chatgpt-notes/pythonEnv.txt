To create a virtual environment in Python, you can use the `venv` module, which is available in Python 3 by default. Here's how you can create a virtual environment:

### Using Command Line (Windows)

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.

2. **Navigate to your project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd path\to\your\project
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv_name
   ```
   Replace `venv_name` with your desired name for the virtual environment.

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   venv_name\Scripts\activate
   ```
   You should see `(venv_name)` in your command prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

### Using Command Line (Mac/Linux)

1. **Open Terminal.**

2. **Navigate to your project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv_name
   ```
   Replace `venv_name` with your desired name for the virtual environment.

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source venv_name/bin/activate
   ```
   You should see `(venv_name)` in your terminal prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

### Notes:
- To deactivate the virtual environment, simply type `deactivate` in the command prompt or terminal.
- The `venv_name` is the name you give to your virtual environment, choose something meaningful to your project.
