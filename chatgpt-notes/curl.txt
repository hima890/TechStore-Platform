The `curl` option to save the body of the resulting response to a file is `-o`.

Here's how you can use it:

```sh
curl -o outputfile.txt https://example.com
```

This command will save the response body from `https://example.com` into a file named `outputfile.txt`.

The `curl` option that defines the HTTP method used is `-X`.

For example, to make a `POST` request, you can use:

```sh
curl -X POST https://example.com
```

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://example.com


The `curl` option to set a cookie with a key-value pair is `-b`.

For example, to set a cookie named `sessionid` with a value of `12345`, you can use:

```sh
curl -b "sessionid=12345" https://example.com
```

The `curl` option to disable the progress display is `-s` (which stands for "silent").

For example:

```sh
curl -s https://example.com
```

The `curl` option to set a body key-value parameter is `-d`.

For example, to send a POST request with a key-value pair in the body:

```sh
curl -d "key1=value1" https://example.com
```

This option is used to send data in the request body, typically for methods like POST or PUT where data needs to be included.
